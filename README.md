# Software Engineering Portfolio

My name is Ariel Rubio, and this is my professional portfolio of projects I have created as a software engineer.

# Projects

## Category to Sub-Category Mapping
Creates sub-categories from categories assigned to entries in a Crunchbase dataset. This project was part of the work I contributed to my DataWorX I course at University of Silicon Valley, where we worked with clients from Nepal to predict which companies would be best to invest in.

## Predicting Growing Technologies
This project was part of my DataWorX II course at University of Silicon Valley. The project was titled the Big-Data Tripartite Project, so called because our team (in San Jose) was tasked with working alongside clients from Israel and Nepal to predict growing technologies, using 2020 Crunchbase data acquired by the clients.
